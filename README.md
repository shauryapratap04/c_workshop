Come, my love, I offer you my heart,
I’ll give you my hands, soft and apart.
Why this sadness, my beloved, tell me true,
With parched lips and longing eyes, what troubles you?

Why, why, my love, do you weep in despair?
Come to me, come, for my heart is laid bare.

Many have burned in the same cruel flame,
Yet I remain steadfast, calling your name.
Take my tired hands, hold them in yours,
In this love, let us find the cure.

You take my joy, and I’ll bear your pain,
Together, let us live, through sunshine and rain.
Come, my love, I offer you my heart,
I give you my love, never to depart.
